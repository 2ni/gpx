This is a tool implemented in python 3 to generate a tcx file from a gpx.
It'll find any peak and add alerts so you know when it starts and what
kind of hill you're facing.
Garmin finally added this feature automatically when you upload a tcx
file to your device. You might still want to get some information beforehand
without your garmin.


## Installation
```
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.1 gpx
pyenv local gpx
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```
python run-py -h # for help
python run.py --speed 27 file.gpx
